A Physics Law Discovery Engine.

This is an interactive web application that demonstrates the principle that physical laws are coordinate-dependent projections of simpler, dimensionless postulates.

## The Theory

This tool is a practical implementation of the ideas described in "The Knowledge Pattern" and "The Uniformity Principle." It posits that "fundamental constants" like `c`, `G`, and `h` are not properties of reality, but artifacts of our arbitrary, human-centric measurement systems (SI units).

The real laws of nature are simple proportionalities (e.g., `Energy ~ Mass`). This engine performs the basis transformation from that simple reality to the complex, constant-laden equations we see in textbooks.
